To compile: run 'make'

1. You are required to modify only thread_func.c. Insert appropriate
   pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock() statements only. 
   Do not modify any other logic. Note that, line #22 should not be
   executed holding the lock.    

2. To test, you may provide any existing file as an argument. For example,
    
   $./blockhash /tmp/something.txt 1   # Computes and prints hash using
                                       # a single thread     
   
   $./blockhash /tmp/something.txt 8   # Computes and prints hash using
                                       # eight threads 

3. You may find it useful to redirect the output to another file
