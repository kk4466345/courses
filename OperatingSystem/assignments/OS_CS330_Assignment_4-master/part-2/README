1. You are required to modify only rwlock.c. Insert appropriate
   code in the provided function template.Do not modify any other logic. 
   Note that, you *must not* change any other file and *must not* declare
   any global/static variables in rwlock.c. However, you may create local
   variables inside the functions.    

2. A sample testcase is provided in main.c. Please see the comments there.
    

3. Design new test cases by modifying main.c to test your code.
